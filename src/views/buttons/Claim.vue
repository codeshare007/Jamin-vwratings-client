          Claiming your avatar gives you a clean slate. Or keeps your slate clean.<br>Picture proof is required with
          negative comments on claimed avis which stops people from making things up.<br>Negative comments without
          pictures will be removed when you claim.

        <p class="mb-4">
          Claiming is simple... In your dashboard, you will see a Claim Avi area. Submit the name you want to claim. A
          timer will start counting down from 7 days. You can restart the timer any time in that 7 days but if you
          don't, your avi will unclaim and any negative comments will show again
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Log in... Head over to your dashboard... Claim your avi !!
